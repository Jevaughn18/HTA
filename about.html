            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>At the Harvest Temple Apostolic church, we are strong believers in faith, family and fruit, the fruit of the Spirit. 
We believe in one God, baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the infilling of the Holy Ghost as referenced in Acts 2:38. 
We believe in holiness and that the Word of God is truth and we suggest for all persons to do the same. 
Harvest Temple Apostolic (any of our branches) welcomes all with open arms and guarantees that you will find a home and a place of true worship, according to St. John 4:24. 
</p>
            <p>We embrace being Agents of Change and boldly declare that “The Spirit of the Lord is upon us, because he hath anointed us to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent us to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.” (St. Luke 4: 18-19)</p>

            <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>At HTA, our greeting is “Praise Jesus.” We believe this declaration sets the tone for holy living, builds faith, and boldly proclaims the power of Jesus' name. Our mission is to spread the Apostolic message of repentance, baptism in Jesus’ name, and the infilling of the Holy Ghost to all nations, staying true to the doctrine taught by the apostles.</p>
            <p><em>“Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” — Acts 2:38</em></p>

            <h2>A Short History Of Harvest Temple Apostolic</h2>
            <p>The Harvest Temple Apostolic Group of Churches was formed in (date to be inserted) by the late Bishop Kingsley O. Carter. After the death of our founder in March 2023, the mantle was passed on to his assistant at the time, Bishop Clifton Campbell, in July 2023.
            Our headquarters office is located in Portsmouth, St. Catherine and over the years, the organization has expanded to include branches in Banks, Clarendon, Slipe Pen Road, Kingston and Mullet Hall, Portland.
